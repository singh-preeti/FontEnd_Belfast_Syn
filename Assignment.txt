1.Write a function which Calculate the sum of multiples of 3 and 5 for a given limit
2.Write a function which checks and count the truthy values from an array
3.Write a function which checks number till given input/parameter is odd or even
4.Write a function which checks given input/parameter
  1.If input/parameter is below speedlimit of 70 print => 'Good Safe Driving'
  2.If input/parameter is above speedlimit of 70, every 5 kilometers is Penalty Point, print => 'Speed Limit Crossed by Penalty Point' + Point 
  3.If Driver gets more than 10 penalty points ie. above the speed limit 120, print => 'License Suspended'

5.Write a function which checks given input/parameter:
   1.If input/parameter is divisible by 3 print => Fizz
   2.If input/parameter is divisible by 5 print => Buzz
   3.If input/parameter is divisible by 3 or 5 print => FizzBuzz
   4.If input/parameter is NOT divisible by 3 or 5 print => given Input Number/Value
   5.If input/parameter is other than Number/Value print => 'Nan - Not a Number! Please Input        Number'
6.Write a function which checks given width and height, returns true (landscape) if width is greater than height and vice versa
7.Write function to check object equality.
 i.e. function Student(name, age, rank, country) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.rank = rank;
  this.country = country;
}
8.Create a function which returns the maximum ie. largest number from an array
