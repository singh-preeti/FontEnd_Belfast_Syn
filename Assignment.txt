Primitive Data Types: 
String ,Number, Boolean, Undefined,Null
Non-Primitive Data Types:
Object
Array
RegExp

Operators:
 Arithmetic
 Comparison / Relational -> == is equal to,=== equal and of the same type
 !=,!==,<=,<,>,>=
 Bitwise -> & (10==20 & 20==30) = false
 Logical
 Assignment
 Special Operators -> delete , in , instanceof, new , typeof, void , ?:
 if(age>18)
   document.write("can vote");
 else
   document.write("Cant vote");

  age>18 ? can vote : can not vote


js array is an object that represents the similar type of data
3 ways to construct array in js:
 1.By array litral
 2.By creating instance of the array (new keywords)
 3.By using an array constuctor.

If condition -> one condition (if its true then it will print  else nothing will get printed)
if else -> two statements (if condition is true if part get executed else the else part)
else if ladder -> more than two statements there will be only one condition true.
nested if -> condition inside the other condition

marks>40 = pass 
marks>40 = pass else fail
marks>40 && marks<60  passed 
marks>60 && marks<75 Fisrt Div
marks>40 
 (java >50) = passed else fail


percentage =  ( totalgrades / 400 ) *  100 ;


 
 Loops-> foreach


1.Write a function which Calculate the sum of multiples of 3 and 5 for a given limit
2.Write a function which checks and count the truthy values from an array
3.Write a function which checks number till given input/parameter is odd or even
4.Write a function which checks given input/parameter
  1.If input/parameter is below speedlimit of 70 print => 'Good Safe Driving'
  2.If input/parameter is above speedlimit of 70, every 5 kilometers is Penalty Point, print => 'Speed Limit Crossed by Penalty Point' + Point 
  3.If Driver gets more than 10 penalty points ie. above the speed limit 120, print => 'License Suspended'

5.Write a function which checks given input/parameter:
   1.If input/parameter is divisible by 3 print => Fizz
   2.If input/parameter is divisible by 5 print => Buzz
   3.If input/parameter is divisible by 3 or 5 print => FizzBuzz
   4.If input/parameter is NOT divisible by 3 or 5 print => given Input Number/Value
   5.If input/parameter is other than Number/Value print => 'Nan - Not a Number! Please Input        Number'
6.Write a function which checks given width and height, returns true (landscape) if width is greater than height and vice versa
7.Write function to check object equality.
 i.e. function Student(name, age, rank, country) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.rank = rank;
  this.country = country;
}
8.Create a function which returns the maximum ie. largest number from an array
9.Create a method named 'includes' which checks an element exists in an array
10.Write a function which show or print Sum of Arguments passed as an Array
